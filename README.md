# Multi-Layer-Network-with-Omnibus-MLN-O
Multi-Layer Network with Omnibus (MLN-O) method is to jointly analyze the association between phenotypes and a SNP. MLN-O uses the score test to test the association of each merged phenotype in a cluster and a SNP and then uses the Omnibus test to obtain an overall test statistic to test the association between all phenotypes and a SNP.
